# Airbnb Pricing Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb pricing data to uncover insights into how various factors such as neighborhood, room type, availability, and reviews influence pricing. The analysis is conducted using data visualization techniques and data manipulation tools.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various variables, with a focus on:
- **Price**
- **Neighborhood groups**
- **Room type**
- **Availability**
- **Reviews**

## Key Insights
- Over 95% of room prices are below $334.
- Neighborhoods like Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx generally have prices under $100.
- Manhattan is the most active neighborhood, followed by Brooklyn.
- The most preferred room type is "Entire home/apt" with 52% of bookings, followed by private rooms at 45.7%.
- "Entire home/apt" rooms have the highest prices, while shared rooms are the cheapest.
- The host named Michael has the most listings with 417 hosts.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation (e.g., handling missing values, filtering, and grouping data).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization (e.g., bar plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps).

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the pricing trends across different neighborhoods and room types, revealing that "Entire home/apt" rooms are in high demand but have limited availability, while shared rooms, though cheaper, are the least preferred.
